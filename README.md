# Assassin's Creed mods for CheatEngine
Although modding Assassin's Creed is almost impossible, the idea is to try making some random stuff to improve certain assets of different AC saga games, using CheatEngine. The main purpose is making things more realistic or difficult.

## Famine Mod (AC3)
What this script does is double up the consumed value, which is usually =1, but when you throw money, you throw 10 units of it, so with Famine you'll throw away 20. I also included something to check if the value would be below 0, because on that case it would make you have negative or infinite money/items (for example, if you have 1 bullet left, and reload, it would be reduced to -1). On that case, Famine is not applied so that issue doesn't happen (at least that's what I noticed on the three items I actually have, including money).
